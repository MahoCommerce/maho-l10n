# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Maho L10N is the central localization **monorepo** for Maho Commerce. It is the source of record for translation strings (CSV) and email templates (HTML) across 11 locales. `en_US` is the source locale; every other locale lives in its own committed folder here.

Translations are produced via **Crowdin autotranslate** (https://translate.mahocommerce.com), whose GitHub integration writes translated files back into the per-locale folders. The individual `maho-language-<locale>` repos on Packagist are **generated artifacts** — published from this monorepo on demand and never edited by hand.

## Workflow

```
Crowdin (autotranslate)  ──►  this monorepo (en_US/, de_DE/, es_ES/, …)  ──►  manual publish  ──►  maho-language-<locale> repos  ──►  Packagist
```

Publishing is manual: trigger the **Publish Language Packs** GitHub Action (`workflow_dispatch`) with a locale list or `all`.

## Architecture

- **`en_US/`** — Source locale with 61 CSV files and email templates under `template/email/`
- **`<locale>/`** — Target locale directories mirroring `en_US`, populated by Crowdin (committed here permanently)
- **`crowdin.yml`** — Crowdin integration mapping source files to translated paths
- **`.build/templates/`** — Files used to generate each satellite repo: `composer.json.tpl`, `README.md.tpl`, `.gitignore`, and `locales.tsv` (locale → human language name map). LICENSE files are reused from the repo root.
- **`.github/workflows/publish-language-packs.yml`** — Manual workflow that, per locale, does an **authoritative rebuild** of the satellite repo (wipes everything except `.git`, lays down only the generated set, so files the build no longer produces are removed), renders metadata from `.build/templates/`, commits, and tags a version (format: `YY.M.D`). Never delete or recreate a satellite repo — that would drop its version tags and break Packagist/installed `composer require`s; the workflow reconciles them in place.

Each generated package is named `mahocommerce/maho-language-<locale lowercased>`, type `maho-module`, requiring `mahocommerce/maho:*`.

### How this interacts with `maho-infrastructure`

Shared org files flow **infra → l10n → language packs**, so there is a single distribution point and no file is written by two systems:

- **`maho-infrastructure`'s `sync.php`** syncs org-wide files (`.github/FUNDING.yml`, `.github/dependabot.yml`) into **this repo only**. Its `language-packs` group opts the `maho-language-*` repos **out** of file sync, while still reconciling their settings/security and forcing them read-only (`has_issues`/`has_wiki`/`has_projects` = false).
- **This publish workflow** owns everything in the satellites: `app/locale/<locale>/…`, `composer.json`, `README.md`, `LICENSE*.txt`, `.gitignore`, the version tags — and **fans out l10n's own `.github/FUNDING.yml`** to each pack (it copies the file infra placed here; it does not keep a second copy).

So the only edit needed when funding/sponsor info changes is in `maho-infrastructure`; it lands in l10n, and the next `publish` run propagates it to every pack.

## CSV Format

Files use quoted comma-separated format: `"source_phrase","translation"`, preserving leading/trailing whitespace and original casing. Terms like "openmage"/"magento" are replaced with "Maho". Some terms are kept untranslated: CMS, newsletter, URL rewrites, layered navigation.

## QA Checks

After translations are updated, verify these strings render correctly: `CMS`, `(Shift-)Click or drag`, `ID`.
